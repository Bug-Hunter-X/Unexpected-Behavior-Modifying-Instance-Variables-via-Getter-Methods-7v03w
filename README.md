This example highlights a subtle issue in Ruby's object model related to instance variable access and modification.  While you can directly change instance variables using `instance_variable_set`, attempting to modify them through a getter method (`value=`) will not work unless explicitly defined as a setter method.  The solution provides a corrected class with a proper setter method.
